⏱️ Stopwatch – Program Description
This is a web-based stopwatch application that allows users to measure elapsed time with Start, Stop, and Reset controls.

The HTML provides the structure, including the time display and control buttons.

CSS styles the stopwatch for a clean and user-friendly interface, centering elements and adding basic design aesthetics.

JavaScript manages the stopwatch logic by keeping track of elapsed time using setInterval(). It updates the display in real time and handles user interactions with the control buttons.

The stopwatch counts in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, and is a great beginner project to practice timing functions, event handling, and dynamic DOM updates.
